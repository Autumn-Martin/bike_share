# As a visitor,
# When I visit the trips index,
# I see the first 30 trips (duration, start date, start station, end date, end station, bike id, subscription type, zip code),
# I also see a button to see more pages of trips,
#
# When I visit a second page, there should be buttons to move both forward and backward in time.
